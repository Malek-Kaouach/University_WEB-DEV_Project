# Web Development Project Description

### The project is essentially covering:

1- Providing information for students about: 
* Final exam schedule by downloading them
* Courses that link to the TBS archive
* Clubs' Facebook pages
* Student affairs: admission, grading system, graduation, academic probation, grading scale
* Academics programs: undergraduate and master
* Contacts

2- Insuring sign-up and sign-in for students to check  their latest grades:
* For the sign-up page, there are several conditions and constraints when putting personal data:
ID shouldn't be repeated and must be composed of 8 digits, and the password should match the repeat password section.
* When the student sign-up correctly he will be redirected to the sign-in page for students.
ID, Username, and password should match the database content.
* After logging in the website will display his personal information with scores that the teacher submitted.

3- Insuring sign-up and sign-in for teachers to add grades or delete them:
* Same conditions in sign-up and sign-in for students.
* The teacher on the sign-up page should select the course that he gives.
* After logging in the website will display his personal information + a form to add grades for the student (conditions available: grades should be between 0 and 100, and all cases should be filled) and the professor's name and his course will be filled directly as default in the form.
* After submitting the form the teacher should refresh the grades table that he will find down below by clicking the refresh button to see the updated grades table.
* The teacher can delete the data by clicking on the delete button on the table.
* The table will just display just students for whom the specific teacher inserted their grades.
